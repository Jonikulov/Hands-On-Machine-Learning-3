**My Approach to the Book Code & Practical:**

-  Document Your Process.
1. Code along with the Book; Apply the code of the book as it is & run.
2. Experiment by tweaking parameters, modifying code, or using different datasets to see how changes affect the outcome, read documentation of libraries/frameworks.
3. Do Exercises.
4. ReImplement every single code yourself (from scratch); Compare your solutions & code to author's (notebooks).
5. After finishing a chapter or section, Build Your Own small Project that uses/applies the concepts that have learned.

**TEMP_NOTE: COMPARE: 02.ipynb -> 1.**

**Example project ideas based on Hands-On ML topics:**

* *Classification:* Build a spam email classifier, sentiment analysis model for movie reviews, image classifier for cats vs. dogs, predict customer churn.
* *Regression:* House price prediction (using more features than in the book's example), predict stock prices (time series forecasting – might require additional time series techniques), predict energy consumption.
* *Clustering:* Customer segmentation for marketing, image segmentation (basic), anomaly detection in network traffic.
* *Dimensionality Reduction:* Visualize high-dimensional datasets, speed up a classification task using PCA.
* *Neural Networks:* Build a simple image classifier, text classifier, or sequence-to-sequence model (e.g., basic translation or text generation).
